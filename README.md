### Overview

This app took me 2 1/2 hours to complete. I used local storage to persist
"favorite symbols" in lieu of a database. It's still a little buggy and not very
responsive but I didn't want to spend too much more time trying to perfect
anything. I think I got the basic functionality down. I didn't understand how to
create an alert without using websockets which would require a paid tier for the
api I used. I hope this is good enough for another interview. I'd be happy to
discuss it more amongst other things in-person!

## Thanks!!!
